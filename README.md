# Task_manager_JS_App

Hey, this is a task manager app made using JavaScript. 

Instruction:
You can add a new Task by clicking the button on your right. Your task will be saved, so feel free to leave the page and come back, but if you want to remove all task refresh your browser two times. To mark a task completed click on the task.

This project saves your task so you can come back to them, you can delete all tasks by refreshing the page twice, you can select a task to turn it to a complete task and it will also keep track of total task and completed tasks. 

The challenging part of this app was creating a way for the task to be saved locally. I was able to do this by using localstorage and having the storage update when you load the page and add a new task.
